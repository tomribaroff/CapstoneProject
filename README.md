# CapstoneProject

This README is an explanation for the context of this repository:

ProjectNotebook.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook File with detailed code of the entire project. It includes the Abstract for project's results, as well as an in depth look at the code involved. 

UnusedCode.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook File with code that I didn't use in my final analysis, but that I think might be useful for anyone else working on this/a similar project. 

APIfunction.py is a python code file which I wrote, which includes the functions I used as part of my analysis on my API responses

Headlines.csv is a CSV file which I created, saving the information which I requested from the API, after my edits

nyt_news_data is a folder containing text files of the responses I got from the NYT API - it was better to save, than make the same repeated requests

Improving Stock Market Predictions...pdf is a short pdf of slides I used in presentation
